# 👋 Hey there! I'm Ubaid

An aspiring **Back-End Developer** turned **Mobile App Alchemist**, currently summoning sleek and scalable solutions with **Flutter** & **Dart**. I’m all about building apps that feel as smooth as they function — because the future deserves better than buggy UI and laggy buttons.

🎓 3rd Semester B.S. Computer Science @ **National University of Modern Languages (NUML), Lahore**
🧠 Constantly learning, building, breaking stuff (intentionally), and leveling up.
