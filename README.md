### 🧩 Fun Facts

- 💭 OOP is basically my second language (Java days got me like: "class in session.")
- ⚡ I enjoy refactoring spaghetti code into Michelin-star-level logic.
- 📚 Side-questing into Design Patterns, App Architecture, and Git mastery.

## 🎮 When I'm Not Coding...

You’ll probably find me gaming. I enjoy:

- ⚽ **EAFC** & **eFootball**

- 🔫 **Call of Duty** (*sniper main* — one shot, one thrill 💥)

From clutching wins to cleaning bugs, I’m built for the grind.
