Hey there! I'm Ubaid, an aspiring Back-End Developer with a passion for building efficient, secure, and scalable systems. I'm currently in my 2nd semester of BS Computer Science at National University of Modern Languages (NUML), Lahore.

🔧 I'm currently working on a Bank Management Application using Java and MySQL—a project aimed at strengthening my backend and database skills through real-world implementation.

💻 I have hands-on experience with:

C++ and Java (including strong fundamentals in Object-Oriented Programming)

Front-End Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

MySQL for relational database design and queries

🧠 I regularly sharpen my problem-solving skills on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank, focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms.

🤝 I'm always open to collaboration, feedback, and learning opportunities. Whether it's contributing to projects, pair programming, or just tech talk—feel free to reach out!
